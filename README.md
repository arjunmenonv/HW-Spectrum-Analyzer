Important Branches:

[branch ver3](https://github.com/murale127/HW-Spectrum-Analyzer/tree/ver3): SpecAnalv2.9 is a working solution (uses AXI-lite bus interfaces), SpecAnalv3 is WiP

[branch ver4_256](https://github.com/murale127/HW-Spectrum-Analyzer/tree/ver4_256): 256 point DFT version, WiP (256 point Float FFT is resource expensive)
