Add useful links, notes and ideas to this doc

Added a document on FFT implementation on hardware to the notes/ folder in the repo for general reference;  we will not have to write the complete HDL model for the FFT module.

So far, I am aware of two options- using Xilinx's FFT IP on vivado, and designing the FFT core using a C program and vivado High Level Synthesis (HLS converts a C code into suitable hardware blocks). The video and code sir referred to in his reply to our mail uses HLS. More info on this to be added.
